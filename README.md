## Interview exercise 

### Notes
Sadly, the exercise is not complete. In my mind this was the task checklist
 * ~~Reify lookup by id on html strings~~
 * ~~Reify lookup by criteria on html strings~~
 * ~~Find element path inside html~~
 * ~~Create app main with file paths inputs~~
 * ~~Parse files from path and call own abstractions~~
 * ~~Run some integration tests~~


A bit late but its fine :shrug:

### Run
Use `sbt run path1 path2` to test
