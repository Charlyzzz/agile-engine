## Interview exercise 

### Notes
Sadly, the exercise is not complete. In my mind this was the task checklist
 * ~~Reify lookup by id on html strings~~
 * ~~Reify lookup by criteria on html strings~~
 * ~~Find element path inside html~~ _kinda..._
 * Create app main with file paths inputs
 * Parse files from path and call own abstractions
 * Run some integration tests
